# # # Scenario # # #

# Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with
#  wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.

# Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall - it's flat.
#  The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains
#  one block more than the layer above.

# Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have,
# and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

# Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers - if the builders
# don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish
# their work immediately.

# _________________________________________________________________________________________

# # # Test Data # # #

# Sample input: 6
# Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 3

# Sample input: 20
# Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 5

# Sample input: 1000
# Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 44

# Sample input: 2
# Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 1

# _________________________________________________________________________________________

# # # Logic # # #

blocks = int(input("Enter the number of blocks: "))
layer = 1
height = 0

while blocks >= layer:
    blocks -= layer
    layer += 1
    height += 1
print("The height of the pyramid:", height)
